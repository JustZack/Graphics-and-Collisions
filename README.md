# Graphics-and-Collisions
A project aiming to compute collisions between 2D objects in a efficient (and fun to code) way.

This project uses SFML for rendering, as such your project needs to be setup to include it.

It should be noted that this project isn't functional in terms of computing collisions, but it will display a few boxes that are meant to bounce off of eachother.
